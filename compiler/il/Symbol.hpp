/**
 * \page Symbols Symbols
 *
 * A Symbol is a name for a program object.
 *
 * In OMR, symbols have three main attributes:
 *
 * - A datatype
 * - A size
 * - A name
 *
 * Symbols are further divided into four subclasses:
 *
 * -# \a RegisterMapped symbols are those that can be mapped to registers.
 * -# \a Static symbols are those that can have an address computed at compile
 *       time.
 * -# \a Method symbols name executable code pieces.
 * -# \a Label symbols give names to locations in code.
 *
 * Symbol creation is done through factory methods.
 *
 * See \ref symbolcreation for details.
