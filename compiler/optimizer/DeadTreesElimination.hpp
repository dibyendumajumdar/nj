 * Class DeadTreesElimination
 * ==========================
 *
 * Expressions that are evaluated and not used for a few instructions can 
 * actually be evaluated exactly where required (subject to the constraint 
 * that their values should be the same if evaluated later). This optimization 
 * attempts to simply delay evaluation of expressions and has the effect of 
 * reducing register pressure by shortening live ranges. It has the effect 
 * of removing some IL trees that are simply anchors for (already) evaluated 
 * expressions and making the trees more compact.
