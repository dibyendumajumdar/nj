/**
 * @brief Convenience API for defining JitBuilder structs from C/C++ structs (PODs)
 *
 * These macros simply allow the name of C/C++ structs and fields to be used to
 * define JitBuilder structs. This can help ensure a consistent API between a
 * VM struct and JitBuilder's representation of the same struct. Their definitions
 * expand to calls to `TR::TypeDictionary` methods that create a representation
 * corresponding to that specified type.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Given the following struct:
 *
 * ```c++
 * struct MyStruct {
 *    int32_t id;
 *    int32_t* val;
 * };
 *
 * a JitBuilder representation of this struct can be defined as follows:
 *
 * ```c++
 * TR::TypeDictionary d;
 * d.DEFINE_STRUCT(MyStruct);
 * d.DEFINE_FIELD(MyStruct, id, Int32);
 * d.DEFINE_FIELD(MyStruct, val, pInt32);
 * d.CLOSE_STRUCT(MyStruct);
 * ```
 *
 * This definition will expand to the following:
 *
 * ```c++
 * TR::TypeDictionary d;
 * d.DefineStruct("MyStruct");
 * d.DefineField("MyStruct", "id", Int32, offsetof(MyStruct, id));
 * d.DefineField("MyStruct", "val", pInt32, offsetof(MyStruct, val));
 * d.CloseStruct("MyStruct", sizeof(MyStruct));
 * ```
